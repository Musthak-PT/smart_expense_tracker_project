# smart_expense_tracker_project


Setup Instructions:

1- Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/Musthak-PT/smart_expense_tracker_project.git
  cd smart_expense_tracker_project


2Ô∏è- Backend Setup (Django REST Framework)

  Create a virtual environment
      python -m venv venv
  
  Activate the virtual environment
  
  Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
  Linux/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate

3- Install Python dependencies

  pip install -r requirements.txt

4-Apply database migrations
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate


5-Create a superuser (optional, for admin panel)
  python manage.py createsuperuser

6-Run the Django development server
  python manage.py runserver 9001(port)
  ackend will now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:9001/



Design Choices:

  1- Database Schema:
  
  User: 
    Uses Django‚Äôs built-in User model for authentication and identification. This avoids reinventing authentication and leverages Django‚Äôs secure password              hashing.
  
  Category:
    Stores expense categories (name). Categories are shared across all users for simplicity and consistency.
  
  Expense: 
    Each expense is linked to a User and a Category, with fields for amount, description, and date.
  
  user ‚Üí ForeignKey to User ensures each expense belongs to a specific user.
  category ‚Üí ForeignKey to Category, with SET_NULL on deletion to keep past expenses intact.
  amount ‚Üí DecimalField with max_digits=10 and decimal_places=2 ensures precision for monetary values.
  date ‚Üí Used for filtering by month/year in reports.
  
  Constraints:
    Foreign keys enforce referential integrity.
    NOT NULL constraints for essential fields like user and amount.
    Ordering: Expenses are ordered by -date by default for easier listing of recent entries


2Ô∏è- SQL Query for Monthly Summary:

  The monthly summary aggregates a user‚Äôs expenses by category and provides a total expense for a given month.
  
  Django ORM implementation:
   expenses_by_category = expenses.values(
        category_name=F('category__name')
    ).annotate(
        total_amount=Sum('amount')
    ).order_by('-total_amount')

3Ô∏è- Additional Design Choices:
  Nested serialization: Expenses include full user and category details in responses for easier frontend rendering.
  
  JWT Authentication: Protects all API endpoints and eliminates the need to pass user_id in requests, enhancing security.
  
  Modular API design: Separate endpoints for Users, Categories, Expenses, and Reports allow scalability and easy maintenance.
  
  Optional Full CRUD: Supports update and deletion of expenses for complete user control.
